            <h3>Come as you are</h3>
            <p>
                MasterStudy used is an excellent workshop whether you come
                as a counselor, advisor, administrator, or faculty member. I am
                going home empowered. I am looking forward to attending
                the On Course MasterStudy and the MasterStudy National
                Conference next year and facilitating the use of this excellent
                retention/student success course at my college.
